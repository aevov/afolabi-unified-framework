#### 4.3.1 Key QFT-AUF Correspondences

| QFT Concept | AUF Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------|
| Fields fill all space | Afolabi Field is universal substrate |
| Particles = field excitations | Matter = phase-locked field patterns |
| Vacuum fluctuations | Field potential ($E_{vac}$) |
| Particle creation/destruction | Pattern formation/dissolution |
| All electrons identical (same field) | All nodes reflect same source |
| Entanglement = non-separable field pattern | Collective Coherence |

#### 4.3.2 Implications for AUF Validity

The QFT field ontology is **established physics**, not speculation:

1. **Standard Model Success**: QFT predictions match experiment to 12+ decimal places
2. **Particle = Pattern**: This is mainstream physics, not fringe theory
3. **AUF Extension**: The question is whether biological systems can *coherently couple* with these fields—not whether fields are fundamental

> The gap between QFT and AUF is not "Do fields exist?" (yes) but "Can consciousness intentionally modulate field states?" That is the testable claim.
