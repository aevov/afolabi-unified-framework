# The Resonant Economy: Coherence as Currency

> **"In a post-scarcity paradigm, reputation isn't social capital—it's operational capacity."**

## The Obsolescence of Competition

Level 4 civilization inverts the fundamental assumptions of scarcity economics:

| Level 1-3 Assumption | Level 4 Reality |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Resources are finite | Information is infinitely copyable |
| Production requires extraction | Production is **Resonant Rendering** |
| Competition allocates scarce goods | Cooperation amplifies collective capacity |
| Winner-take-all dynamics | $N^2$ collective gain |
| Money represents claim on matter | Coherence contribution represents trust |

When reality is **rendered** rather than **extracted**, the zero-sum logic of competition becomes meaningless.

## Coherence Reputation: The New Currency

### What Is It?

**Coherence Reputation** is your verified track record of constructive contribution to the planetary mesh. It determines:

1. **Phase-Lock Eligibility**: Who you can co-manifest with
2. **Rendering Scale**: Maximum complexity of your manifestations
3. **Anchor Node Status**: Whether you stabilize or destabilize others

### The Reputation Formula

```
ReputationScore(t) = ∫₀ᵗ [𝕄_contribution(τ) × stability_factor(τ)] dτ
```

Where:
- **𝕄_contribution**: Your Mirror Constant contribution during manifestation events
- **stability_factor**: Whether your participation increased or decreased overall mesh coherence

### Reputation Classes

| Class | Score Range | Privileges |
|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------|
| **Anchor** | > 0.95 | Global phase-lock authority, emergency stabilization |
| **Resonator** | 0.80 - 0.95 | Multi-jurisdictional manifestation, collective rituals |
| **Contributor** | 0.50 - 0.80 | Local manifestation, standard mesh participation |
| **Observer** | 0.20 - 0.50 | Read-only mesh access, learning mode |
| **Isolated** | < 0.20 | Decoupled from collective operations |

## Currency Comparison Table

| Attribute | Fiat Currency | Cryptocurrency | AEVCoin (Coherence Token) |
|:----------|:--------------|:---------------|:--------------------------|
| **Backing** | Government decree | Proof-of-work/stake | Proof-of-coherence |
| **Creation** | Central bank printing | Mining/staking | Manifestation contribution |
| **Transfer** | Bank ledger | Blockchain ledger | Mesh phase-lock record |
| **Value Source** | Trust in institution | Scarcity + speculation | **Verified reality stabilization** |
| **Inflation** | Unlimited | Algorithmically controlled | **Anti-inflationary** (coherence is conserved) |

## The AEVCoin: Coherence-Backed Token

### Minting

AEVCoin is **minted** when:
1. A manifestation succeeds (𝕄 > 0.8 at completion)
2. Your participation increased collective stability
3. The rendered object persists beyond handover

```
AEV_minted = base_rate × 𝕄_contribution × complexity_factor × duration
```

### Burning

AEVCoin is **burned** when:
1. A manifestation fails due to dissonant intent
2. Your participation destabilized the mesh
3. Intentional harm detected by consensus

### Use Cases

| Use Case | AEVCoin Function |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| Large-scale manifestation | Stake required for $N^2$ participation |
| AFT Pro access | Subscription paid in AEV |
| Anchor node delegation | Vote with staked AEV |
| Cross-jurisdiction rendering | Bridge fee in AEV |

## Why Reputation, Not Followers

Traditional "reputation" systems (followers, likes, credit scores) measure:
- **Attention** (who looked at you)
- **Debt capacity** (how much you can borrow)
- **Popularity** (who agrees with you)

Coherence Reputation measures:
- **Constructive contribution** (did reality stabilize when you participated?)
- **Intent clarity** (was your signal clean or noisy?)
- **Handover success** (did your manifestations persist?)

This is **verified by the mesh**, not by social consensus. You cannot fake coherence—the field knows.

---

## Economic Implications

### 1. No Hoarding
Coherence cannot be stockpiled. Your reputation is a **time integral**—it reflects sustained contribution, not a single event.

### 2. No Gatekeeping
Anyone can contribute to the mesh. Low reputation doesn't block participation—it just limits scale until you've demonstrated stability.

### 3. Automatic Redistribution
High-coherence nodes naturally attract more phase-lock requests, but the $N^2$ law means **their success increases everyone's capacity**.

### 4. Obsolete Institutions

| Old Institution | Replaced By |
|:----------------|:------------|
| Banks | Mesh Consensus |
| Credit Bureaus | Coherence Ledger |
| Patent Offices | Pattern Attribution (automatic) |
| Insurance | Collective Stabilization |
| Central Banks | **Imhotep Protocol** (anti-entropy) |

## Integration with Global Coherence OS

The **Kemet Edition** of the Global Coherence OS includes:

1. **Coherence Ledger**: Immutable record of mesh contributions
2. **Reputation Oracle**: Real-time calculation of reputation scores
3. **Anchor Registry**: List of verified high-coherence nodes
4. **Handover Tracker**: Persistence verification for manifested objects

All 193 jurisdictions participate in the same coherence accounting system.

## Transition Path

### Phase 1: Parallel Economy (Current)
- AEVCoin exists alongside fiat
- Early adopters earn coherence reputation
- AFT Pro subscriptions payable in AEV or fiat

### Phase 2: Preference Shift (2027+)
- High-reputation nodes prefer AEV settlement
- Manifestation services quote in AEV
- Legacy economy begins integration

### Phase 3: Coherence Standard (2030+)
- International settlements in AEV
- Fiat becomes local-only
- Reputation supersedes credit

## Summary

> **Competition is a Level 1-3 artifact.**  
> In Level 4, the question isn't "who wins?"—it's "how stable is our collective field?"

The more minds align, the more reality becomes stable—not scarcer.  
Coherence is the new currency. Reputation is its ledger.
