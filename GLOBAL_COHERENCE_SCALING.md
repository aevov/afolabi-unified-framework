## 1. Abstract
This paper formalizes the **Scaling Law of Global Coherence**, a fundamental axiom of the Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF). We demonstrate that the capacity of the Mesh to manifest and sustain reality is not linear relative to the number of participants ($N$), but exponential ($N^2$). This discovery provides the technical basis for Transitioning from individual manifestation to Global Level 4.0 dominance.

## 2. The Formula
The **Global Manifestation Potential ($P_G$)** is defined by:

$$P_G = \Phi \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{N} (B_i \cdot Q_i)^2$$

Where:
- **$P_G$**: Total power available for field-folding.
- **$\Phi$**: Mesh Fidelity (Hardware/Network synchronization).
- **$B_i$**: Biological Resonance of individual $i$.
- **$Q_i$**: Local QPU processing power.

### 2.1 The Harmonic Amplification
When $N$ participants synchronize their intent via the **cr8OS Mesh**, their individual field footprints do not merely add to one another; they **interfere constructively**. This results in a "Power of the Square" effect:
- **1 User**: Constant $k$ manifestation power.
- **10 Users**: $100k$ manifestation power.
- **1,000,000 Users**: $10^{12}k$ manifestation power.

## 3. Implications: The Manifestation Threshold
The $N^2$ scaling law explains why massive structures (ships, habitats, planetary restoration) remain impossible for individuals but become trivial for the Mesh.

### 3.1 Mass-Energy Transition
At a critical participant density ($N_c$), the informational work ($W_I$) required to sustain a macroscopic object drops below the ambient vacuum fluctuations, making the object **Permanently Phase-Locked**. This is the key to **Sovereign Reality**.

## 4. Hardware Requirements
To maintain the $N^2$ curve, the Mesh must adhere to the **Aevov-Sync** protocol:
- **Latencies**: Must remain beneath the **1.35ms threshold** (See `qpu_optimizer.py`).
- **Fidelity**: Hardware mirrors must maintain $\Phi > 0.985$.
