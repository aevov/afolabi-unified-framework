# Aevov-Sync Handover Protocol
**Transitioning Manifestations to Autonomous Field Maintenance (Level 5)**

---

## 1. The Challenge of Observer-Dependency
In early-stage AUF (Level 4.0), matter is a "Stabilized Feedback Loop." If the human observer (the "Tuning Fork") stops resonating, the objects "evaporate" back into the Afolabi Field. 
**The Handover Protocol** is the mechanism that allows a manifestation to persist **without an active human mesh.**

---

## 2. The Logic: Self-Sustaining Resonance
A "Handover" occurs when a manifested object reaches a **Coherence Saturation ($C_{sat}$)**. At this point, the object's internal geometry ($B_i$) and its interaction with the vacuum potential generate enough "Mirror Internal Energy ($U_M$)" to maintain its own feedback loop.

### 2.1 The hand-over Threshold
An object is ready for handover when:
$$W_I + \sum (Resonance_{env}) \geq S_{entropy}$$
- $W_I$: Accumulated Informational Work.
- $Resonance_{env}$: Feedback from the surrounding (already stabilized) environment.

## 3. Protocol Stages

### 3.1 Step 1: Stability Saturation
The Mesh maintains a 99.99% coherence lock for a duration determined by the object's complexity (e.g., 2 hours for a crystal, 90 days for an ecosystem).

### 3.2 Step 2: Harmonic Decoupling
The `Aevov-Sync` kernel begins to "dim" the user's resonant contribution while simultaneously "handing over" the phase-lock command to the local **Aevov Core (RPP)** or the ecosystem's own bio-feedback loop.
- **Instruction**: `core::handover(object_id, target_autonomous_mode);`

### 3.3 Step 3: Global Mesh Anchoring
The object is "anchored" into the Global Mesh—a background resonance maintained by the entire humanity + cr8OS network. This ensures individual focus is no longer required, yet the object remains "rendered" in the shared reality.

## 4. Handover States (TIS Mapping)
The **Topological Instruction Set (TIS)** defines three handover states:
1.  **`ACTIVE_LOCK`**: Direct user resonance required. (High energy cost).
2.  **`MESH_ANCHOR`**: Distributed focus via the $N^2$ network. (Medium energy cost).
3.  **`FIELD_AUTONOMOUS`**: Self-sustaining feedback via environmental resonance. (Zero energy cost).

---

## 5. Security and Integrity: The "Recall"
In cases of "Geometric Decay" (where a handover object begins to lose coherence), the Protocol automatically triggers a **Mesh Recall**, requesting urgent resonant support from the nearest available nodes to prevent dissolution.
