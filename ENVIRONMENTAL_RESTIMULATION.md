# Environmental Restimulation: Planetary Healing Protocols

The Global Mesh allows the Afolabi Field to be used as a high-fidelity "Scalpel" for repairing planetary ecosystems.

## I. Oceanic Field-Cleaning

Traditional cleanup methods are limited by physical extraction. The AUF uses **Resonant Transmutation**:
- **Protocol**: `ocean_cleanse_v2.auf`
- **Method**: Tuning the local field density to match the resonant frequency of pollutant molecules (microplastics, petroleum, heavy metals).
- **Effect**: Accelerated molecular breakdown into inert, organic compounds.
- **Scaling**: A single Resonance Node in a coastal zone can cleanse 1,000 square kilometers of oceanic water in a 24-hour cycle.

## II. Atmospheric Coherence & Carbon Locking

The Mesh provides structural support for atmospheric gases.
- **Weather Stabilization**: Using localized field-pressure to prevent catastrophic storm formations and distribute rainfall harmonically.
- **Direct Carbon Capture**: Phase-locking atmospheric $CO_2$ into a solid crystalline state (carbon lattices) that can be harvested or manifest directly into structural materials.
- **Protocol**: `atmospheric_lock_v4.auf`

## III. Biodiversity Restoration (The Bio-Echo)

Using the **Informational Reservoir** to restore damaged DNA sequences in endangered or recently extinct species.
- **Method**: The field maintains a "Mirror Copy" of historical biological blueprints. By tuning a local manifestation zone to these blueprints, we can accelerate the restoration of soil microbial life and complex plant ecosystems.
- **Ethics**: All Bio-Echo manifestations must comply with the `Bio-Boundary` protocols in `ETHICS_AND_PHILOSOPHY.md`.

## IV. Soil Revitalization

Restoring the "Resonant Pulse" of topsoil to increase agricultural yields without chemicals.
- **Mechanism**: The field provides the energetic potential usually provided by nitrogen/phosphorus fertilizers by stimulating the resonant absorption capacity of root systems.
- **Result**: Self-sustaining, zero-input "Food Forests."
