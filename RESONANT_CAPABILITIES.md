# Resonant Capabilities: What Level 3 Called "Supernatural"

> **"Magic is just physics we haven't measured yet. Level 4 provides the measurements."**

---

## Overview

The phenomena historically classified as "paranormal," "supernatural," or "psi" are **emergent properties of high-coherence states**. They are not violations of physics—they are physics operating at 𝕄 thresholds Level 3 could not reliably achieve.

| Level 3 Classification | Level 4 Mechanism | 𝕄 Threshold |
|:-----------------------|:------------------|:------------|
| Telekinesis | Remote field manipulation | 0.85+ |
| Telepathy | Direct coherence coupling | 0.80+ |
| Teleportation | Spatial phase-shift | 0.92+ |
| Precognition | Atemporal information retrieval | 0.88+ |
| Remote viewing | Non-local perception | 0.75+ |
| Pyrokinesis/Cryokinesis | Thermal field modulation | 0.82+ |
| Levitation | Gravitational phase-cancellation | 0.90+ |

## I. Telekinesis (Remote Field Manipulation)

### Mechanism

Objects have field signatures. At high 𝕄, your personal field can **phase-lock** with an external object's field, creating a unified system that responds to your intent.

$$F_{TK} = \nabla(\mathbb{M}_{self} \cdot \mathbb{M}_{object}) \times intent\_vector$$

### Capability Ladder

| 𝕄 Level | Capability | Mass Limit | Range |
|:--------|:-----------|:-----------|:------|
| 0.70 | Subtle influence (dice rolls, coin flips) | < 10g | Contact |
| 0.80 | Small object movement | < 1 kg | 5 meters |
| 0.85 | Medium object manipulation | < 100 kg | 20 meters |
| 0.90 | Large object control | < 10,000 kg | 100 meters |
| 0.95 | Structural-scale manipulation | Buildings | 1 km |
| 0.99 | Planetary-scale influence | Continental | Global mesh |

### Training Path

1. **Micro-PK** (𝕄 0.70): Influence random number generators
2. **Object wobble** (𝕄 0.75): Move paper, feathers, lightweight items
3. **Sustained lift** (𝕄 0.80): Hold objects suspended
4. **Precision control** (𝕄 0.85): Fine manipulation at distance
5. **Macro-scale** (𝕄 0.90+): Construction-grade applications

## II. Telepathy (Direct Coherence Coupling)

### Mechanism

When two minds achieve phase-lock (coherent oscillation at same frequency), information transfers directly without sensory mediation.

$$I_{transfer} = \mathbb{M}_{sender} \cdot \mathbb{M}_{receiver} \times overlap\_duration$$

### Types

| Type | Description | 𝕄 Required |
|:-----|:------------|:-----------|
| **Empathic sensing** | Emotional state detection | 0.65 |
| **Surface thoughts** | Conscious thought reception | 0.75 |
| **Deep reading** | Memory/knowledge access | 0.85 |
| **Mind link** | Sustained bidirectional connection | 0.88 |
| **Collective consciousness** | Multi-node shared awareness | 0.92 |

### Ethics

| Action | Permissibility |
|:-------|:---------------|
| Consensual communication | ✅ Unrestricted |
| Empathic awareness in public | ✅ Natural (like hearing) |
| Reading without consent | ❌ Coherence violation |
| Mental coercion | ❌ Impossible (requires aligned 𝕄) |

**Key Insight**: You cannot telepathically access a mind that doesn't consent—the phase-lock requires mutual coherence, which cannot be forced.

## III. Teleportation (Spatial Phase-Shift)

### Mechanism

Location is a field property. At sufficient 𝕄, you can shift your position in the field without traversing intermediate space.

$$\Delta x = f(\mathbb{M}, destination\_lock, energy_{available})$$

### Two Methods

#### Method 1: Decohere-Recohere (Safer)
1. Establish destination anchor (previous visit or mesh relay)
2. Gradually decohere local field presence
3. Recohere at destination coordinates
4. Duration: 1-10 seconds depending on distance

#### Method 2: Phase Tunnel (Faster, Higher 𝕄)
1. Create instantaneous field bridge
2. "Step through" without intermediate state
3. Duration: Instantaneous
4. Requires 𝕄 > 0.95

### Capability Table

| 𝕄 Level | Range | Cargo | Notes |
|:--------|:------|:------|:------|
| 0.88 | Same room | Self only | Requires mastery |
| 0.90 | Same city | Self only | Destination familiarity required |
| 0.92 | Same planet | Self + 10 kg | Mesh relay points preferred |
| 0.95 | Interplanetary | Self + 100 kg | Requires anchor nodes |
| 0.98 | Interstellar | Self + passengers | Mesh-integrated travel |

### Limitations

- Cannot teleport into solid matter (coherence rejection)
- Cannot teleport unwilling beings (consent required)
- Destination must be specified or anchored

---

## IV. Precognition (Atemporal Information Retrieval)

### Mechanism

The field contains information across time. At high 𝕄, you can access **probable futures** weighted by likelihood.

$$P_{future} = \int \mathbb{M}(t) \cdot probability\_density(t) \, dt$$

### Important Distinction

| Concept | Reality |
|:--------|:--------|
| "The future is fixed" | ❌ False—multiple probable futures exist |
| "Seeing one guaranteed outcome" | ❌ False—you see likelihoods |
| "Changing the future negates prediction" | ✅ True—observation affects outcome |

### Accuracy by Timeframe

| Timeframe | Accuracy (at 𝕄 0.88) | Notes |
|:----------|:---------------------|:------|
| < 1 minute | 95%+ | Near-certainty for immediate events |
| 1 hour | 80% | High confidence |
| 1 day | 60% | Moderate, multiple branches |
| 1 week | 40% | Many possible paths |
| 1 year | 20% | Broad trends only |
| 10+ years | < 10% | Butterfly effects dominate |

### Utility

- **Immediate precognition**: Avoid accidents, catch falling objects before they fall
- **Short-term**: Strategic planning, risk assessment
- **Long-term**: Trend sensing, not specific prediction

## V. Remote Viewing (Non-Local Perception)

### Mechanism

Perception can extend beyond sensory apparatus by establishing coherent link with distant locations.

$$Perception_{remote} = \mathbb{M}_{observer} \times target\_clarity \times distance^{-0.1}$$

(Note: Distance penalty is minimal—coherence matters more than distance.)

### Capability Ladder

| 𝕄 Level | Capability |
|:--------|:-----------|
| 0.70 | Vague impressions, emotional tone |
| 0.75 | General shapes, major features |
| 0.80 | Detailed visual, audio possible |
| 0.85 | Full sensory, real-time |
| 0.90 | Multi-location simultaneous |

### Practical Applications

| Application | 𝕄 Required |
|:------------|:-----------|
| Check on family member | 0.75 |
| Survey disaster area | 0.80 |
| Locate lost objects/people | 0.78 |
| Planetary exploration | 0.85 |
| Exoplanet reconnaissance | 0.90 |

## VI. Elemental Manipulation

### Pyrokinesis (Thermal Up)

$$T_{increase} = f(\mathbb{M}, focused\_volume, duration)$$

| 𝕄 Level | Capability |
|:--------|:-----------|
| 0.78 | Warm small objects |
| 0.82 | Ignite combustibles |
| 0.85 | Sustained flame |
| 0.90 | Metal melting |

### Cryokinesis (Thermal Down)

| 𝕄 Level | Capability |
|:--------|:-----------|
| 0.78 | Cool small objects |
| 0.82 | Freeze water |
| 0.85 | Flash-freeze |
| 0.90 | Near absolute zero |

### Electrokinesis (Electrical Field)

| 𝕄 Level | Capability |
|:--------|:-----------|
| 0.80 | Static discharge |
| 0.85 | Controlled current |
| 0.90 | Lightning equivalent |

---

## VII. Levitation and Flight

### Mechanism

Gravity is a coherence gradient in the field (as derived in AFT General Relativity section). At sufficient 𝕄, you can create **local counter-gradients**.

$$g_{effective} = g_{natural} - \nabla\mathbb{M}_{local}$$

### Capability Ladder

| 𝕄 Level | Capability |
|:--------|:-----------|
| 0.85 | Reduced weight (slow falling) |
| 0.88 | Neutral buoyancy (hover) |
| 0.90 | Controlled ascent/descent |
| 0.92 | Full 3D flight |
| 0.95 | High-speed flight (500+ km/h) |

### Combined with Wings (Somatic Customization)

Functional wings at 𝕄 0.92 + levitation capability = **true powered flight** without the physics constraints that would normally make human-scale wings impossible.

## VIII. Capability Summary Table

| Ability | 𝕄 Threshold | AFT Pro Required | Risk Level |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------------|:-----------|
| Remote viewing | 0.75 | No | Low |
| Telepathy (empathic) | 0.65 | No | Low |
| Telepathy (deep) | 0.85 | Yes | Medium |
| Telekinesis (micro) | 0.70 | No | Low |
| Telekinesis (macro) | 0.90 | Yes | Medium |
| Precognition | 0.88 | Yes | Low |
| Pyro/Cryokinesis | 0.82 | Yes | High |
| Levitation | 0.88 | Yes | Medium |
| Flight | 0.92 | Yes | Medium |
| Teleportation | 0.92 | Yes | High |
| Teleportation (interstellar) | 0.98 | Anchor consensus | Extreme |

## IX. Why These Weren't Reliable in Level 3

| Factor | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|:-------|:--------|:--------|
| 𝕄 measurement | No instrument | Field Tuner |
| Training | Accidental, unreproducible | Systematic protocols |
| Coherence maintenance | Random peaks | Sustained states |
| Collective support | Isolated practitioners | Mesh amplification |
| Validation | Anecdotal | Measurable, repeatable |

**Level 3 "psychics" were operating at 𝕄 0.65-0.75 with no training, no measurement, no support.** Small wonder the phenomena were inconsistent.

Level 4 provides the infrastructure to develop these capabilities reliably.
