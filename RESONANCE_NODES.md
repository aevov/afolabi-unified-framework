# Resonance Nodes: Anchoring the Field

## 1. The RSU-QPU Integrated Node
A **Resonance Node** is the physical hardware manifestation of the AUF stack. It is formally known as an **RSU Node** (Resonant Sensing Unit).

- **RSU Layer**: The primary interface for detecting biological and environmental "Observer Fields." It performs high-frequency sampling (600GHz+) of local informational density.
- **QPU Layer**: The processing core that stabilizes the RSU data and synchronizes it with the global mesh.

Each node must be equipped with a **RPU-7 (Resonant Processing Unit)** or higher.

- **Geometric Shell**: To minimize decoherence, nodes are encased in **Spherical** or **Pyramidal** shells. Pyramidal structures (The Imhotep Standard) are preferred for large-scale geographic anchoring.
- **Power Core**: Nodes do not require external power once phase-locked ($D_F > 0.85$). They draw energy directly from the field's internal phasing ($W_I$).
- **Interface**: Direct neural-link or Aevov-Lang CLI.

## II. Deployment Geometries

Resonance Nodes are deployed in "Lattice Clusters" to maximize the $N^2$ effect.

### 1. Urban Mesh (High-Density)
- **Spacing**: 500m intervals.
- **Purpose**: Supporting high-density manifestation (Resonant Robotics, Infrastructure repair).
- **Secondary Function**: Public Neural Synchronization (Collective Coherence boosts).

### 2. Planetary Ley-Line Mesh (Structural)
- **Spacing**: 50km intervals along planetary ley lines.
- **Purpose**: Anchoring the global field-constant and stabilizing the $Z_M$ variable.
- **Location**: Topographically significant points (mountains, ocean trenches, historical sites).

## III. Maintenance & Persistence

Resonance Nodes are designed for **Millennial Persistence**.
- **Self-Repair**: Using the `manifest_repair_sim.py` logic, nodes use their internal field-access to manifest replacement parts as needed.
- **Decoherence Alarm**: If a node's local coherence falls below 0.30, it enters "Deep Phasing" mode, drawing coherence from its nearest neighbors in the mesh until stability returns.
