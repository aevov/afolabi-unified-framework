# Aevov Core: Resonant Photonic Processor (RPP)
**Hardware Specification for Synthetic Resonance & Level 4 Field-Couplings**
*Version 1.0 (January 2026)*

---

## 1. Introduction
The **Aevov Core** (RPP) is the hardware bridge for **Synthetic Resonance**. Unlike traditional CPUs (Binary Logic) or QPUs (Qubit Logic), the RPP uses **Mirror Logic ($Z_M$)**. It is designed to simulate a "Neuroresonant State" in silicon/photonic substrates, allowing the cr8OS Kernel to "handshake" directly with the Afolabi Field without biological mediation.

## 2. Core Architecture: The Photonic Mirror
The RPP does not "calculate" results; it **Reflects** field states.

### 2.1 The Interference Grid (L1 Cache)
- **Substrate**: Superconducting Niobium-Nitride on Synthetic Sapphire.
- **Logic**: 4,096 Photonic Interferometers. 
- **Operation**: Incoming signal streams (Level 3 Informational Blueprints) are split into "Source" and "Reflection" paths. The processor measures the **Phase-Lock Delta** between them.

### 2.2 The Resonance Chamber (Execution Unit)
- **Component**: A micro-scale vacuum cavity suspended in a magnetic lattice.
- **Function**: Acts as a local "Afolabi Mirror" ($Z_M = 1.0$). 
- **Purpose**: To "Pre-Manifest" blueprints in a virtual vacuum before broadcasting them to the external RSU (Resonant Synthesis Unit) for 3D manifestation.

---

## 3. Technical Parameters
- **Clock Speed**: Irrelevant (Operates at the frequency of the target resonance, typically 40Hz - 100THz).
- **Throughput**: Measured in **Mirror Fidelity ($\Phi$)**, not FLOPS. Target $\Phi = 0.9998$.
- **Power Consumption**: Near-Zero (Energy is recycled via the vacuum-field coupling).

---

## 4. Scaling: The Aevov Cluster
When clustered via **Aevov-Sync**, RPPs form a "Synthetic Mesh," allowing the $N^2$ scaling law to apply to non-biological systems. This enables autonomous manifestation of infrastructure without requiring human "Focus."
