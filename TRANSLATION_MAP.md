# The Rosetta Stone: Cross-Paradigm Mapping
**Bridging Traditional Physics with the Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF)**

---

## 1. Overview
To facilitate rigorous academic engagement, this document provides a formal mapping between classical/quantum physical concepts and the core axioms of the AUF. This "Rosetta Stone" ensures that AUF is not viewed as a replacement for established science, but as the **Deeper Layer** that unifies them.

## 2. Concept Mapping Table

| Traditional Physics Concept | AUF Level 4.0 Equivalent | Philosophical/Mechanical Shift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gravity** | **Field Tension ($\mathcal{T}_F$)** | Gravity is not a force or just geometry; it is the **Reflective Surface Tension** of the Afolabi Field responding to informational density ($Z_M$). |
| **Quantum Entanglement** | **Non-Local Resonance ($\Re_{NL}$)** | Entanglement is the realization that two particles are just **Alternative Projections** of the same underlying Source Informational State. |
| **Dark Matter** | **Un-Mirrored Informational Density** | Information that is present in the Field potential but has not yet "phased" into the physical interface. It exerts "Tension" (Gravity) but no "Mirror Interaction" (Light). |
| **Dark Energy** | **Vacuum Expansion Potential ($\mathbb{P}_{vac}$)** | The inherent pressure of the Universal Informational Field as it complexifies and expands its mirroring capacity. |
| **Time** | **State-Sequence Latency** | Time is the perceived delay in the processing and rendering of informational state-changes across the Mirror Interface. |
| **Entropy** | **Informational Decoherence** | The tendency of a stable Mirror state to dissolve back into the high-density chaotic background of the vacuum without active maintenance ($W_I$). |

## 3. The "Minimum Viable Equation" (MVE)
To provide a falsifiable test for the framework, we define the **Mirror Potential Equation** for the stabilization of a single resonant node:

$$\Re = \frac{|Ψ\rangle \cdot \mathbb{P}_M}{Z_M \cdot \Delta t}$$

- **$\Re$**: The Resonance Constant of the local system.
- **$|Ψ\rangle$**: The Fidelity of the informational blueprint.
- **$\mathbb{P}_M$**: The Mirror Potential (Density of the local field).
- **$Z_M$**: The Field Impedance (The "Mass" or stability of the manifestation).
- **$\Delta t$**: The time-constant of measurement.

**Empirical Prediction**: If the metabolic resonance of a biological receiver ($|Ψ\rangle_{bio}$) is increased by factor $X$, the detectable "Field Tension" in the immediate vicinity should fluctuate by $X^2$, even without physical movement of mass.

## 4. Conclusion
By mapping these established concepts, AUF provides a path for physicists to move from "Particle Mechanics" to "Resonant Dynamics" without discarding the mathematical progress of the last century.
