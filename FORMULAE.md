# AUF Manifestation Formulae
**The Mathematical Bridge from Thought to Thing**

## 1. The General Manifestation Formula ($M_f$)
The core equation governing the transition of an Informational Seed into Physical Reality:

$$M = \frac{I \cdot R}{\Delta Z_M} \cdot \Theta$$

Where:
- **$M$**: Manifestation Fidelity (0.0 - 1.0).
- **$I$**: Informational Density of the Seed (Instruction bits).
- **$R$**: Resonant Coherence of the Interface (Handshake quality).
- **$\Delta Z_M$**: Mirror Impedance Delta (The energy/tension required to break symmetry).
- **$\Theta$**: The Feedback Persistence constant ($W_I$ maintenance).

## 2. The Phase Transition Coefficient ($C_p$)
Determines at which point "Potential" cools into "Matter":

$$C_p = \frac{f_{lock}}{T_{latency}}$$

- High $C_p$ results in "Instant Rendering."
- Low $C_p$ results in "Ghosting" or unstable manifestations.

## 3. The Mirror Strike Energy ($E_s$)
The "Cost" of manifestation:

$$E_s = \int_{singularity}^{matter} \Psi \cdot \delta Z$$

- This represents the Informational Work ($W_I$) required to compress n-dimensional potential into 3D coordinate space.

## 4. The Persistence Law
An object remains solid as long as:

$$\sum (R_{n}^2) \geq S_{entropy}$$

- Where $N$ is the number of participants in the Mesh.
- This links the Manifestation Formula directly to the **N^2 Scaling Law**.
