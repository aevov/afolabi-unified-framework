- **Documentation**: Clarifying the Aevov Trinity concepts.
- **Public Testing**: Running the basic AFT validation on diverse quantum systems.

Please open a Pull Request for any proposed changes.

## Institutional & Commercial Collaboration
The core, full-scale Afolabi Field Theory (AFT) implementation is currently closed-source to protect cr8OS proprietary technologies. 

If you are an academic researcher or a commercial partner interested in:
- High-fidelity 8K spatial rendering (Nara Engine)
- Advanced 33,333:1 Mirror Compression
- Coherence Medicine applications
- Wave 4 AI integration

Please contact the **cr8OS Foundation** at [research@cr8os.com](mailto:research@cr8os.com) to discuss access to the **AFT Pro v5.x** engine.

## Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to uphold the principles of rigorous scientific inquiry and ethical AI development.
