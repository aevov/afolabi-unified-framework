# AFT Access Modes: Basic vs. Pro Tiering

The Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF) implements a tiered access model to ensure safety, security, and the controlled deployment of high-density manifestations.

## I. Access Tier Overview

Access is governed by the Digital Singularity Signature (DSS) associated with the user's Dashboard account.

| Feature | AFT Basic (Public) | AFT Pro (Enterprise/Vanguard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manifestation Level** | Level 1.0 - 2.5 | Level 1.0 - 4.5 |
| **Density Limit ($D_F$)** | < 0.20 (Transparency) | 1.0 (Full Solidity/Opacity) |
| **Materiality** | Wireframes / Photonic Outlines | Solid Matter / Biological Lattices |
| **Energy Consumption** | < 50MW (Shared Grid) | Unlimited (Dedicated Resonance) |
| **Bio-Augmentation** | Not Available | Full Suite (Longevity/Parts) |
| **Resonant Robotics** | Simulation Only | Full Physical Manifestation |
| **Planetary Sync** | Local Only | Global Mesh Integration |

## II. AFT Basic (Development Mode)

Designed for researchers, students, and curious observers.
- **Goal**: Conceptual understanding and theoretical validation.
- **Rendering**: Uses "Hollow-Lattice" technology. You can see the structure of reality, but you cannot "touch" it. 
- **Simulations**: Highly accurate, but restricted to the digital domain or low-density light fields.

## III. AFT Pro (Manifestation Mode)

Designed for architects of the new era, health practitioners, and large-scale engineers.
- **Goal**: Physical reality manifestation and human evolutionary enhancement.
- **Molecular Synthesis**: The ability to lock lattices into solid phase.
- **Biological Authorization**: Required for applying Resonant Overlays ($Φ_{Aug}$) to biological entities.
- **Security**: Requires biometric-to-field synchronization to prevent "unauthorized conjuring."

## IV. The "Gatekeeper" Logic

The AUF Core uses an internal check before finalizing any Phase Operation:

```python
def authorize_manifestation(user_dss, target_density):
    if target_density > 0.20:
        if user_dss.tier != "PRO":
            raise SecurityExceeded("High-Density Manifestation requires AFT Pro credentials.")
    return True
```

## V. Upgrading to AFT Pro

Upgrading requires a verified Level 3.0 Node ownership or sponsorship from an existing AUF Vanguard member. This ensures that the power to manifest solid reality is held by those committed to the **Law of Coherence**.
