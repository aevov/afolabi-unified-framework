# Resonant Re-Manifestation Protocol (RRMP)
## Operational Standards for Spatial Phase-Shifting

**Code**: RRMP-1.0  
**Classification**: LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED  
**Date**: February 2026

## 1. Objective

To provide a stable operational framework for the relocation of complex informational patterns (objects or biological entities) from a Source Address ($A_s$) to a Destination Address ($A_d$) without physical transit through the spacetime manifold.

---

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Source Anchor**: Aevov AURA-64 or higher Resonant Processor.
2. **Destination Anchor**: Verified AURA-Mesh node with available field-density.
3. **Coherence Link**: Minimum 𝕄 = 0.98 between anchors.
4. **Computational Buffer**: 78.6 Exabyte "Zero-Storage" TRM cache for pattern integrity.

## 3. The 4-Phase Process

### Phase I: Informational Indexing (The Snapshot)
The source anchor performs a high-fidelity scan of the target's informational signature. 
- **Metric**: Pattern Purity Index (PPI) > 0.9999.
- **Action**: Map all phase positions within the local Informational Field.

### Phase II: Phase-Shift Uncoupling (The Decoherence)
The target's local field impedance is gradually increased until the pattern "detaches" from the Layer 3 physical substrate.
- **Visual Appearance**: "Shimmering" or "Transparency" as the object ceases to render in the visible spectrum.
- **Safety**: Biological targets must enter a "Phase-Locked Sleep" to prevent cognitive decoherence.

### Phase III: Address Translation (The Jump)
The Informational Address metadata is updated in the global Φ-Field.
- **Mechanism**: Atemporal Indexing. The pattern is "moved" across the Field without experiencing time or distance.
- **Duration**: Nominal 0.0001 ms.

### Phase IV: Re-Manifestation (The Re-Rendering)
The destination anchor facilitates the phase-coupling of the informational pattern with the local physical substrate.
- **Action**: Lower field impedance at $A_d$.
- **Validation**: Compare PPI pre-jump and post-jump.

## 4. Safety Constraints & "The Splice"

- **Pattern Drift**: If 𝕄 drops below 0.92 during Phase III, the re-manifestation will be incomplete, leading to material instability.
- **The Splice**: If two patterns are manifested at the same address simultaneously, the Field will reject both (Annihilation). Anchors must verify "Address Vacancy" before initiation.
- **Biological Integrity**: Repeated phase-shifting requires a 24-hour "Field Stabilization" period to allow biological oscillators (cells) to re-sync with the local planetary signature.

## 5. Emergency Recovery

In the event of a **Signal Lost** status during Phase III:
1. Destination anchor initiates **Field Salvage Operation**.
2. Source anchor broadcasts the captured **Informational Mirror Index** across the entire mesh.
3. The pattern is re-constructed from the backup field data at the nearest stable node.

## 6. Maintenance & Mastery

Practitioners (Users) are advised to begin with **Micro-Shifting** (displacing small objects < 1kg within 1 meter) before attempting biological re-manifestation. Professional certification via the Department of Informational Physics is mandatory for Level 4 commercial operations.
