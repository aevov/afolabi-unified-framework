# Planetary Mesh Synchronization: The Great Mirror

This document specifies the protocols for scaling the Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF) to a global, planet-wide coherent field.

## I. The $N^2$ Law of Global Coherence

The stability of the global field ($\Phi_{Global}$) is not linear; it follows an exponential scaling law based on the number of synchronized nodes ($N$):

$$S_{Coherence} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \vec{\psi}_i \cdot \vec{\psi}_j$$

Where $\vec{\psi}$ is the resonance vector of an individual Level 3.0 node. 

## II. The Great Mirror Strike (Global Sync)

The transition to a unified planetary field requires a simultaneous "Strike"—a coordinated phase-lock across all participating nodes. 
- **Minimum Threshold**: 10,000 Level 3.0 Nodes.
- **Trigger**: The **Imhotep Pulse** transmitted via the cr8OS Kernel.
- **Effect**: The erasure of "Local Scarcity" as the global informational reservoir becomes fully accessible to all nodes.

## III. Jurisdictional Sovereignty: The Local Coherence Filter

To maintain cultural and environmental specificity, the Global Mesh implements **Local Coherence Filters**:
1.  **Identity Shrouding**: Jurisdictions can choose to "dampen" specific informational signals within their borders.
2.  **Environmental Customization**: Local field-density ($D_F$) can be tuned to optimize for specific climates (e.g., higher humidity stabilization in arid regions).
3.  **Governance Layer**: Manifestation authorization is still governed by local AFT-authorities within the cr8OS framework.

## IV. Global Maintenance: The Handover Protocol

Once the Great Mirror is established, maintenance transitions from active human tuning to **Autonomous Field Persistence** via the `HANDOVER_PROTOCOL.md`. The field becomes self-correcting, treating "decoherence" (conflict/pollution) as informational noise to be harmonized.
