### Theoretical Framework
The Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF) is a theoretical and mathematical framework currently undergoing empirical validation. While it integrates established principles from quantum information theory and biophotonic research, it represents a novel synthesis.

### No Medical Advice
References to **Coherence Medicine** and neuroresonant effects are theoretical and research-oriented. The Afolabi Unified Framework does NOT provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The biological models included (e.g., biophoton coherence) are computational simulations intended for research purposes.

### Trade Secrets
The code provided in this public repository is a **Basic Validation Suite**. It does not represent the full fidelity or performance of the commercial AFT engine used in cr8OS products. The proprietary 33,333:1 compression and Nara Engine orchestration are protected trade secrets.

### Energy Transformation Compliance
All theoretical models of **Resonant Synthesis** described in the Afolabi Unified Framework adhere to the **Law of Conservation of Energy**. Synthesis is documented as a transformation of background field potential into localized physical mass ($E=mc^2$) and does not imply the creation of energy or matter from nothing.
