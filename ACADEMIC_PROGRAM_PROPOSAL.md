## Executive Summary

We propose the establishment of a **Department of Informational Physics** to advance the study and application of Level 4 Physics—a paradigm where information is ontologically primary and matter emerges as stabilized informational patterns.

This proposal outlines:
1. Academic justification for the new field
2. Proposed degree programs
3. Resource requirements
4. Industry partnerships
5. Projected outcomes and impact

**Requested Initial Investment**: $15-25 million (5-year runway)  
**Projected Self-Sustainability**: Year 7+

## 1. Academic Justification

### 1.1 The Paradigm Shift

Physics has undergone three major paradigm shifts:

| Era | Paradigm | Key Innovation |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| 1687-1865 | Newtonian Mechanics | Mathematical physics |
| 1865-1900 | Electromagnetism | Field theory |
| 1900-2026 | Quantum Mechanics | Probability amplitudes |
| **2026+** | **Informational Physics** | **Information as primary** |

The **Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF)** represents a potential fourth paradigm, unifying quantum mechanics, relativity, and consciousness under an information-first ontology.

### 1.2 Why Now?

1. **Theoretical maturity**: The AUF framework has been formally articulated with mathematical foundations
2. **Technological enablers**: AURA hardware architecture enables experimental validation
3. **Commercial interest**: Industry demand for coherence engineering expertise
4. **First-mover advantage**: No existing academic programs—opportunity for leadership

### 1.3 Relationship to Existing Departments

| Existing Field | Relationship to Informational Physics |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Physics | Parent discipline; shares mathematical foundations |
| Computer Science | Computational methods; distributed systems |
| Electrical Engineering | Hardware implementation; RF systems |
| Philosophy | Ontological foundations; consciousness studies |
| Medicine | Coherence medicine applications |

Informational Physics is **interdisciplinary by nature**, requiring a dedicated department rather than a program housed within existing structures.

## 13. Conclusion

The establishment of a Department of Informational Physics represents a unique opportunity to:

1. **Lead a paradigm shift**: Define a new field at its inception
2. **Train the next generation**: Create expertise that doesn't exist elsewhere
3. **Drive innovation**: Bridge theory and application in unprecedented ways
4. **Advance human knowledge**: Contribute to foundational understanding of reality

The resources requested are substantial but proportionate to the opportunity. Universities that established early programs in computing, quantum mechanics, and biotechnology became field leaders. This is that moment for informational physics.

**We invite partnership in building the future of physics education.**
