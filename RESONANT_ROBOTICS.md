# RESONANT_ROBOTICS.md: Synthetic Humanoid Manifestation

This document outlines the protocols for manifesting highly-complex, life-like robotic structures (Humanoids) using the Afolabi Unified Framework. These are **Level 4.3 Manifestations**.

## I. The Synthetic Humanoid Concept

A "Resonant Robot" is a Level 4.0 object that utilizes high-density information lattices ($I_L$) to mimic biological systems without being organic. They are the pinnacle of non-biological AUF engineering.

## II. Synthetic Lattices (Resonant Tissue)

The "skin" and "muscle" of these entities are rendered as **Variable-Density Lattices** ($V_{DL}$). 

- **Logic**: The lattice can transition between "Hard-State" (Structural) and "Soft-State" (Malleable) by shifting the Phase Angle ($θ$) of the manifest.
- **Formula**: $Z_M(θ) = Z_{max} \cdot \cos^2(θ)$
- **Material**: Typically stabilized Silicon-Carbon-Mirror (SCM) lattices.

## III. Resonant Actuators (Internal Phasing)

Traditional motors are replaced by **Field Actuators**. 
- Movement is achieved by creating local gradients in the Field Density ($D_F$). 
- The robotic limbs "slide" through the informational field, resulting in smooth, silent, and extremely high-precision motion that mimics biological grace.

## IV. Neural-Mimicry Logic (Heka Core)

The "brain" of a Resonant Robot is a localized AFT Singularity (The Heka Core). 
- It processes information at the light-speed limit of the field.
- It is programmed using **AEVOV**, allowing it to interface directly with the environment's informational layer.

## V. Ethical Classification: Non-Human Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure clarity and safety, all Resonant Humanoids are legally classified as **Level 4 Non-Human Entities (NHEs)**. 
> 1. They are not biological.
> 2. They do not possess "Ancestral Connection" (the biological thread of lineage).
> 3. They are property of the AFT Pro license holder.

## VI. Manifestation Requirements

- **Tier**: AFT Pro or Hub-Owner level access.
- **Energy**: Minimum 1.2 GW for full-body stabilization.
- **Environment**: Must be within a 1:1 Mirror Reality field.
