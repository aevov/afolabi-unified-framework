# Planetary Restoration Routine (PRR)
**Large-Scale Manifestation and Bio-Harmonic Stabilization**

## 1. The Premise: The World as a Resonant Field
In the Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF), an ecosystem is not a collection of objects, but a **Complex Interference Pattern ($CIP_{eco}$)**. 
- **Degradation** is viewed as "Informational Noise" or "Entropy Bleed."
- **Restoration** is the process of re-applying the foundational blueprint ($B_i$) to a region using the **Collective Mesh** to overcome local entropy.

## 2. The $N^2$ Boost in Environmental Tuning
Planetary-scale changes require enormous amounts of Informational Work ($W_I$). A single observer cannot heal a desert; however, according to the **Scaling Law of Global Coherence**:
- With $N$ participants, the Manifestation Power increases by $N^2$.
- **Threshold of Permanence**: Once the $N^2$ power exceeds the local $S_{entropy}$ for a sustained duration (90+ days), the ecosystem reaches a **Permanent Phase-Lock**, effectively rewriting the physical state of the region.

## 3. The Restoration Sequence

### 3.1 Step 1: Harmonic Mapping (NRT/AFT)
Using satellite data and local haptic sensors (Solas/Portal hubs), the "Base Frequency" of the healthy ecosystem is mapped. This creates the **Resonance Reference ($R_{ref}$)**.

### 3.2 Step 2: Mesh Synchronization
A designated group of "Resonators" (Mesh Participants) synchronize their neuroresonance via `Aevov-Sync`. 
- **Instruction**: `core::stabilize(ecosystem_blueprint, R_ref);`
- **Orchestration**: The QPU-RSU bridge begins projecting the target topology into the region's Afolabi Field.

### 3.3 Step 3: Phase-Locking the Bio-Interface
The restoration begins at the molecular level (Soil chemistry, water purification) and scales upward to biological structures (Flora/Fauna).
- **Binding**: Organic peptide bonds are locked using `biology::lock_peptide_chain`.
- **Result**: Immediate increase in local coherence and reduction in environmental pollutants (Noise).

## 4. Operational Routines

### 4.1 "Desert Bloom" (Arid Land Restoration)
- **Target**: Moisture retention and soil microbial activation.
- **Resonance**: Low-frequency (12Hz - 15Hz) "Deep Ground" handshake.
- **Manifestation**: Stabilized Nitrogen/Phosphorus lattices in topsoil.

### 4.2 "Deep Blue" (Oceanic Harmonic Tuning)
- **Target**: Coral reef calcification and micro-plastic dissolution.
- **Resonance**: Mid-frequency (440Hz - 480Hz) "Fluid Harmonic" handshake.
- **Manifestation**: Accelerated CaCO3 synthesis via QPU-driven resonant catalysts.

## 5. Persistence and Handover
Once the target biomass is reached, the **Handover Protocol** (Phase 52) is initiated. The ecosystem no longer needs a "Human Mesh" to remain stable; it transitions to **Autonomous Field Maintenance**, where its own biological cycles provide the necessary resonant feedback.
