## Voiceover Direction
- **Voice:** Calm, authoritative, slightly reverent (think David Attenborough meets Brené Brown)
- **Pace:** Measured, not rushed—let visuals breathe
- **Tone:** Inviting, not selling; wonder, not hype

## Music Direction
- **Style:** Cinematic ambient, Hans Zimmer influence
- **Key Elements:** 
  - Sub-bass pulse (40Hz foundation—theta wave)
  - Ethereal pads (healing frequencies: 432Hz, 528Hz)
  - Crescendo at 0:25-0:30 for mesh reveal
  - Resolution to warmth for family scene
  - Single sustained note for logo reveal

## Act Structure

### ACT 1: The Incubation (0:00-5:00)

**Key Moments:**
- 0:30 - First voxel materializes
- 2:00 - Voxels begin subtle oscillation

**Camera:** Orbiting the compression point  
**Color:** Deep purple core (#7c3aed), cyan shell  
**Audio:** Frequency drops, gravity-like pull in bass  
**Narrative:**
> *"What we call a black hole is not emptiness. It is density beyond measure—information so concentrated it bends space itself."*

**Key Moments:**
- 10:30 - Compression begins
- 12:00 - Central singularity forms
- 13:30 - Light bends around core
- 14:45 - Tension peaks, holds

## Production Notes

1. **Sync with Solas:** Future versions should allow pairing with Solas device for real-time coherence feedback during viewing
2. **Personalization:** Act durations could adapt based on user's measured coherence (longer Acts for deeper states)
3. **Skip Prevention:** Consider no skip controls for full experience, or "commitment mode" option
4. **Post-Experience:** Suggest 5-minute integration silence before returning to activity
