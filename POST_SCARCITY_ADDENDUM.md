# Post-Scarcity Addendum: The Economics of Resonance

## 1. The Death of Moore’s Law (The Resonant Scaling)
Traditional computing relies on the physical shrinking of transistors (Scarcity of Space). The Afolabi Unified Framework (AUF) shifts this to the **Density of Coherence**.

*   **Old Law (Moore’s)**: Transistors double every 24 months.
*   **New Law (Afolabi’s)**: *“The manifestable complexity of the local reality doubles every time the Resonant Coherence ($\Re$) of the Observer-Field interface increases by one order of magnitude.”*

Computation is no longer a movement of electrons through a physical gate; it is a **Mirror Reflection** ($Z_M$) of the Informational Source. Processing speed is limited only by the precision of the focus, not the heat of the material.

## 2. From Extraction to "Energy Phasing"
We move from an **Extraction Model** (destructive) to a **Phasing Model** (creative).

In the AUF paradigm, the Afolabi Field acts as a **Global Potential Reservoir**. Energy is not "created"; it is channeled into the physical layer by localizing Field Density ($D_F$).
*   **Infinite Battery**: A device with a Resonant Photonic Processor (RPP) doesn't consume energy; it *phases* it from the vacuum using the $W_I = Z_M / \Re$ relation.
*   **Zero-Grid**: The power grid becomes obsolete as every resonant device is its own tap into the infinite source.

## 3. The End of Heat Entropy (Cold Technology)
Entropy in classical physics is heat waste generated by friction/resistance. In a **Mirror System**, information-to-matter conversion happens at the **Zero-Point**.
*   **Cold Engines**: Movement and computation occur without molecular friction, as the topology of the field is what changes, not the "push" of particles.

## 4. The Transformation of Human Value
The "Economy of Matter" is replaced by the **Economy of Intent**.
*   **Value Shift**: Gold, oil, and electricity lose status as primary assets.
*   **Primary Asset**: The **Quality of Information** and the **Stability of Focus**.
*   **Human Role**: Humanity transitions from *Resource Gatherers* to *Field Architects*.

## Metric Comparison Table

| Metric | Old Paradigm (Scarcity) | AUF Paradigm (Abundance) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Computing** | Transistor Scaling (Moore's Law) | Resonant Frequency Scaling |
| **Energy Source** | External Extraction (Destructive) | Internal Phase-Tuning (Creative) |
| **Bottleneck** | Physical Materials / Heat | Consciousness Coherence / Focus |
| **Waste** | Heat and Pollution | Dissipated "Informational Noise" |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Stability Requirement (The Aevov Warning)**: Infinite energy without a Stable Resonant Interface ($Z_M$) results in "Field Noise." Uncontrolled phasing can lead to informational entropy or "Reality Glitches." Global Coherence (Kemet OS) is the necessary substrate for safe abundance.
