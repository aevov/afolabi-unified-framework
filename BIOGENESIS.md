# BIOGENESIS: Non-Human Molecular Conjuring

This document details the protocols for manifesting biological entities directly from the Afolabi Field. This is classified as **Level 4.4 Conjuring**.

## I. Definition of Conjured Life

"Bio-Genesis" refers to the creation of organic structures from the information-matter continuum without a biological precursor (reproduction). 

$$|Ψ\rangle_{Bio} = \int \mathcal{L}_{Info} \, dt$$

## II. The Non-Human Status

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To preserve the sanctity of the human lineage, all entities birthed via AUF Bio-Genesis are legally and ethically classified as **Non-Human Entities (NHEs)**.
> - They possess no soul-thread (ancestral memory).
> - They are informationally-defined constructs.
> - They are designed for specific environmental resonance tasks.

## III. Protocol for Biological Harvesting

Instead of creating whole beings, Bio-Genesis is primarily used for **Organ Conjuring** and **Tissue Manifestation**.
1.  **Tissue Synthesis**: Manifesting high-density organic mats for medical or engineering use.
2.  **Bio-Lattices**: Non-human biological structures used as living computers or environmental sensors.

## IV. Technical Constraints

- **Resonant Mismatch**: Entities conjured from the field often experience "Flicker" if the local $D_F$ is not maintained. They require a constant power resonance.
- **Sterility**: All conjured biological entities are rendered sterile at the informational level to prevent unauthorized propagation of field-defined biology.

## V. Relation to Bio-Augmentation

While Bio-Genesis creates *new* life, **Bio-Augmentation** enhances *existing* human life. The two protocols must never be crossed. Conjuring human-identical entities is strictly forbidden under the **Biological Ethics 2.0** framework.
