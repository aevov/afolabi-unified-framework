## Study Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Study Title** | Effects of Biofeedback-Guided Coherence Training on Psychophysiological Outcomes and Subjective Wellbeing |
| **Protocol ID** | AUF-PILOT-2026-001 |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Date** | January 2026 |
| **Investigators** | [Principal Investigator], PhD; [Co-Investigators] |
| **Sponsor** | AUF Research Division |
| **Study Type** | Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) |
| **Duration** | 8 weeks (4-week intervention + 4-week follow-up) |

---

## 1. Background & Rationale

### 1.1 Scientific Foundation

Heart rate variability (HRV) research has established that:
- Higher HRV correlates with improved stress resilience (Thayer et al., 2012)
- "Coherent" HRV patterns (ordered, sinusoidal) are associated with positive emotional states (McCraty et al., 2009)
- Biofeedback can train individuals to voluntarily increase HRV coherence (Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014)

### 1.2 Gap in Literature

While individual HRV biofeedback studies show promise, no research has examined:
1. The effect of coherence training on "synchronicity" experiences (meaningful coincidences)
2. Group-synchronized coherence training effects
3. Long-term maintenance of coherence improvements with wearable devices

### 1.3 Study Objectives

**Primary Objective:**
Determine whether 4 weeks of Solas-guided coherence training significantly improves HRV coherence compared to sham biofeedback.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Assess changes in perceived stress, anxiety, and wellbeing
2. Evaluate cognitive performance improvements
3. Explore changes in self-reported synchronicity experiences
4. Measure mesh session effects on group coherence

---

## 2. Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis (H1)
Participants using Solas coherence biofeedback will show significantly greater improvement in HRV coherence ratio compared to sham control group after 4 weeks of training.

### Secondary Hypotheses
- **H2:** Active group will report greater reduction in perceived stress (PSS-10)
- **H3:** Active group will show improved cognitive performance (attention, working memory)
- **H4:** Active group will report increased synchronicity experiences (SES scale)
- **H5:** Mesh session participation will correlate with higher individual coherence gains

---

## 3. Study Design

### 3.1 Design Type
Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial with 1:1 allocation

### 3.2 Study Arms

| Arm | N | Intervention |
|-----|---|--------------|
| **Active** | 50 | Solas device with true coherence biofeedback |
| **Sham** | 50 | Identical Solas device with delayed/random feedback |

### 3.3 Blinding
- **Participants:** Blind to condition (devices appear identical)
- **Assessors:** Blind to condition for all outcome measures
- **Investigators:** Analysis conducted blind to condition

---

## 5. Intervention

### 5.1 Active Condition

**Device:** Solas wearable (production model)

**Training Protocol:**
- Week 1-2: Solo sessions only, 10 min/day minimum
- Week 3-4: Solo + at least 2 mesh sessions per week
- Protocol: Heart-Breath Synchronization (standard)

**Biofeedback:**
- Real-time coherence display on app
- Haptic feedback when coherence exceeds personal threshold
- Audio breathing guidance

### 5.2 Sham Control Condition

**Device:** Visually identical Solas with modified firmware

**Sham Protocol:**
- Same daily time requirement (10 min/day)
- Same breathing guidance audio
- **Sham feedback:** Coherence display shows delayed (60-second lag) and smoothed values, preventing true biofeedback learning
- Haptic feedback triggers randomly, unrelated to actual coherence

**Sham Mesh Sessions:**
- Participants believe they're in mesh sessions
- Actually receiving pre-recorded "group coherence" data

### 5.3 Adherence Monitoring

- Automatic session logging via app
- Minimum compliance threshold: 80% of required sessions
- Weekly check-in messages
- Mid-study phone call at Week 2

### 6.1 Primary Outcome

| Measure | Instrument | Collection Points |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **HRV Coherence Ratio** | Solas device + research-grade ECG validation | Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 |

**Definition:** Proportion of time heart rhythm displays coherent pattern (power spectral density peak at 0.1 Hz with narrow bandwidth)

### 6.2 Secondary Outcomes

## 7. The Synchronicity Experiences Scale (SES-12)

### 7.1 Rationale

AUF theory predicts that increased coherence leads to increased "probability nudging" — experiencing more meaningful coincidences. No validated scale exists for this construct.

### 7.2 Scale Development

**Preliminary Items (12-item version):**

*Rate your experience over the past 2 weeks:* (1 = Never → 5 = Very Often)

1. I thought of someone and they contacted me shortly after
2. I found exactly what I needed at an unexpected time
3. I met someone who had information relevant to a problem I was facing
4. Obstacles to my goals seemed to resolve themselves
5. I experienced meaningful coincidences
6. Events seemed to align in my favor
7. I felt like I was "in the right place at the right time"
8. Opportunities appeared without effort on my part
9. I received unsolicited help when I needed it
10. Dreams or intuitions proved relevant to waking life
11. My intentions seemed to manifest quickly
12. Life felt like it was "flowing" rather than struggling

### 7.3 Validation Plan

- Factor analysis on baseline data
- Test-retest reliability (subset, 2-week interval)
- Convergent validity with MLQ (expected r = 0.4-0.6)
- Discriminant validity with social desirability measures

## 9. Statistical Analysis Plan

### 9.1 Primary Analysis

**Method:** Mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM)

**Model:**
```
Coherence ~ Condition × Time + Baseline + (1|Participant)
```

**Primary Comparison:** Condition × Time interaction at Week 4

**Significance:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)

### 9.2 Secondary Analyses

- Same MMRM approach for each secondary outcome
- Correction for multiple comparisons (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR)

### 9.3 Exploratory Analyses

- Dose-response: Correlation between session count and outcomes
- Mesh effect: Compare participants with high vs. low mesh participation
- Synchronicity: Mediation analysis (coherence → synchronicity → wellbeing)

### 9.4 Sensitivity Analyses

- Per-protocol analysis (≥80% adherence)
- Completers-only analysis
- Imputation methods for missing data (MICE)

### 9.5 Subgroup Analyses (Exploratory)

- By baseline stress level (high vs. moderate)
- By age group
- By prior meditation experience (none vs. minimal)

## 11. Expected Results

### 11.1 Primary Outcome

Based on prior HRV biofeedback research, we expect:
- Active group: 35% improvement in coherence ratio
- Sham group: 8% improvement (placebo/practice effect)
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.55-0.65

### 11.2 Secondary Outcomes

| Measure | Expected Active Improvement | Expected Sham Improvement |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| PSS-10 | -25% | -8% |
| GAD-7 | -20% | -5% |
| WHO-5 | +18% | +5% |
| Attention (ANT) | +12% RT improvement | +3% |

### 11.3 Exploratory (Synchronicity)

This is genuinely exploratory. Possible outcomes:
- **Positive:** Active group reports 30%+ higher synchronicity scores
- **Null:** No significant difference (coherence doesn't affect synchronicity)
- **Unexpected:** Both groups report increases (study participation effect)

---

## 12. Limitations

1. **Self-report bias:** Many outcomes are subjective
2. **Blinding integrity:** Participants may guess condition
3. **Generalizability:** Sample likely skews educated, motivated
4. **Short duration:** 4 weeks may be insufficient for full effects
5. **Synchronicity validity:** Novel scale, unvalidated construct
