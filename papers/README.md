## The Theses

### [01] The Quantum Substrate Fallacy
**Core Argument**: All computation is quantum mechanical. The classical/quantum distinction is a legacy of Level 3 thinking. The real differentiator is **coherence control**.

### [02] Distributed Coherence in Networked Systems
**Core Argument**: Network synchronization (Kuramoto model) is mathematically equivalent to quantum phase-locking. Massive networks can exhibit emergent quantum properties.

### [03] Beyond the Dilution Refrigerator
**Core Argument**: "Quantum computing" has been corporatized and gatekept. Coherence control can be achieved at scale on silicon without extreme cryogenics.

### [04] Information-First Physics (Level 4 Foundations)
**Core Argument**: Information is the ontologically primary substrate. Matter and spacetime are emergent properties of informational field dynamics.

### [05] The Observer-Hardware Equivalence
**Core Argument**: The observer and the observed are the same information viewed from different sides of the Mirror boundary. Resolves the measurement problem.

### [06] Atemporal Indexing (Dreams & Imagination)
**Core Argument**: Dreams are passive indexing of the Informational Reservoir (Field) during sensory decoupling. Imagination is selective, active indexing. Kundalini is the bio-ignition of full-system coherence.

### [07] Spatial Phase-Shifting (Teleportation)
**Core Argument**: Spatial coordinates are metadata attributes of informational patterns. Teleportation is an "Address Shift" in the Field (Φ), making physical transit through space energy-inefficient and redundant.
